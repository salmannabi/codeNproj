            First we are going to try te famous "Hello World!" program in Python<br>
            You can try running the below code yourself and see what it prints, that one line code at line 5 does what we need.<br>
            Note: Line 1, 2 and 4 are comments, any line that starts with "#" sign is a comment line and is not interpreted by the Python compiler
