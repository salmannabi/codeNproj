            Just like in any other programming language we rely on variables to keep track of data in our programs.
            <br>
            In Python variables are declared without infering their data types, the python interpretor knows the data type based on its value, for example, look at the string variable below, its data type is not assigned but the value is inside quotation marks "" this indicates to the python interpretor that this variable contains a string.
            <br><br>
            <code>name = "Python"</code>
        </p>

            Below we give a few examples of different types of variables, note none of the variables have any data types associated with them but by printing the data types of these variables we can see how the program is interpreting it
